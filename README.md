    I’m Amir Mahdi Asadi , I started developing since 2018 ,  I interested in android app development and continued with java and kotlin ( I can’t code them now ) just after developing several apps  , I was looking for public apis , That was enough to decide to learn backend but how ? Python answered my question and printed “Hello World”. Nice but what is the framework ?  Django answered my question again and printed  “The Install Worked Successfully! Congratulations!”, I tried to write clean , maintainable , reusable and testable code, I needed to work on hard challenges then I created different scenarios, I used many amazing technologies like docker , kafka, celery , redis , graphql , postgresql , mongodb ,etc ...
